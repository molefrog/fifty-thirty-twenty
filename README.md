Fifty Thirty Twenty
===================
An expense tracking application based on a [50-30-20 rule](https://www.thebalance.com/the-50-30-20-rule-of-thumb-453922).
This budgeting rule helps people to wisely manage their expenses and savings. Here is what it is based on:
  1. 50% you spend on **"needs"**: life-related things like helthcare, rent, food etc.
  2. 30% you spend on **"wants"**: restaurants, leisure etc.
  3. 20% you save.
